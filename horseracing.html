                            down the curtain on an extraordinary career. But then A.P. McCoy has always done things his way. In Winner: My Racing Life, AP reflects upon his unparalleled career, taking the reader from his humble beginnings in County Antrim
                            to the emotional day at Sandown when horse racing bade a tearful farewell to arguably its greatest ever star. McCoy relates in forensic detail the process that led to his decision to retire, recalls some of his greatest rides,

                            His depth of resources meant that on a unique occasion at Wincanton in January 2006, he became the first trainer ever to have six winners on a card. But it is for his role as the trainer of horses such as See More Business,
                            Kauto Star and Denman, all of them Cheltenham Gold Cup winners, that he is best known. In this revealing and honest memoir, Champion Trainer Nicholls explains how he got to the top of his sport, and provides a

                        <p class="synopsis">As a jockey, Kieren Fallon had a unique rapport with his horses, often coaxing them to victory when others had struggled. His skill and commitment made him a punter’s favourite. His magnificent record, which saw him crowned Champion
                            Jockey on six occasions, ensured he became one of racing’s biggest stars. But that was only ever part of the story. Having come over to the UK from Ireland to make his name, Fallon’s combative nature brought him to the attention
                            of the racing authorities. When he dragged a rival jockey off his mount in 1994, he began a series of run-ins that would eventually see him on trial in the Old Bailey, accused of race fixing. Although the judge eventually ruled

                                came in the shape of a bottle of vodka or a meal that had to be ‘flipped’ immediately to ensure he maintained his weight. He worked with some of the best trainers and won all the biggest races, but true happiness only ever
                                really came to him when he was on the back of a horse – a joy that he still feels now that he has retired from racing as he rides work early in the morning.

                            sport. Founded by the legendary horse trainer Vincent O'Brien, and now managed by John Magnier, Coolmore Stud has grown from a small breeding farm into a global behemoth, renowned the world over for the quality of the horses
                            it produces. Alan Conway tells the story of how Coolmore Stud and its training operation at Ballydoyle have come to dominate the world of horse breeding and racing.

                        <p class="synopsis">After almost 30 years in racing, Frankie Dettori has seen it all. Arriving at Luton airport at the age of 14 with no English and a tag around his neck like Paddington Bear, Dettori soon found fame and success in and out of the
                            saddle. Having become the first teenaged jockey since Lester Piggott to win more than 100 races in a season, he went on to ever greater success, reaching a peak when (uniquely in racing history) he won all seven races on the
                            card at Ascot in September 1996. Famous for his flying dismounts after winning a race, he quickly became a housewife's and punter's favourite - the one modern jockey to transcend the sport. He has won all the big races, and

                            horses, and reveals the truth about his work with the trainers and owners who have supported him. Dettori has always lived life to the full - now he is sharing his remarkable story with all those who have followed his career
